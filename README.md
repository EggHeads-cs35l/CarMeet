CarMeet - A web app (viewable on PC and mobile) for car enthusiasts to find other car enthusiasts on a social platform mimicking dating apps (e.g. Tinder, Bumble).

We will be using the most recent Node and NPM to date:
- Node: v18.11.0
- NPM: v8.19.2

### Step 2: Install dependencies
In the directory, run the command:
```sh
npm i
```
Package Dependencies:

### Step 3: Test port
Run the command:
```sh

If it succeeds, it will display a prompt asking to direct to something like: (http://localhost:3000).
The port number may be different depending on your setup.

If it does not succeed, return to Step 2.
